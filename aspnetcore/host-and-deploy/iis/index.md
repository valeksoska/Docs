# Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS

By [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex)

[Install the .NET Core Hosting Bundle](#install-the-net-core-hosting-bundle)

## Supported operating systems

The following operating systems are supported:

* Windows 7 or later
* Windows Server 2008 R2 or later

[HTTP.sys server](xref:fundamentals/servers/httpsys) (formerly called WebListener) doesn't work in a reverse proxy configuration with IIS. Use the [Kestrel server](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel).

For information on hosting in Azure, see <xref:host-and-deploy/azure-apps/index>.

## Supported platforms

Apps published for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) deployment are supported. Deploy a 32-bit app unless the app:

* Requires the larger virtual memory address space available to a 64-bit app.
* Requires the larger IIS stack size.
* Has 64-bit native dependencies.

## Application configuration

### Enable the IISIntegration components

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

A typical *Program.cs* calls <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder*> to begin setting up a host:

```csharp
public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        ...
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

A typical *Program.cs* calls <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder*> to begin setting up a host:

```csharp
public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        ...
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

**In-process hosting model**

`CreateDefaultBuilder` calls the `UseIIS` method to boot the [CoreCLR](/dotnet/standard/glossary#coreclr) and host the app inside of the IIS worker process (*w3wp.exe* or *iisexpress.exe*). Performance tests indicate that hosting a .NET Core app in-process delivers significantly higher request throughput compared to hosting the app out-of-process and proxying requests to [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) server.

The in-process hosting model isn't supported for ASP.NET Core apps that target the .NET Framework.

**Out-of-process hosting model**

For out-of-process hosting with IIS, `CreateDefaultBuilder` configures [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) server as the web server and enables IIS Integration by configuring the base path and port for the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module).

The ASP.NET Core Module generates a dynamic port to assign to the backend process. `CreateDefaultBuilder` calls the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilderIISExtensions.UseIISIntegration*> method. `UseIISIntegration` configures Kestrel to listen on the dynamic port at the localhost IP address (`127.0.0.1`). If the dynamic port is 1234, Kestrel listens at `127.0.0.1:1234`. This configuration replaces other URL configurations provided by:

* `UseUrls`
* [Kestrel's Listen API](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#endpoint-configuration)
* [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) (or [command-line --urls option](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#override-configuration))

Calls to `UseUrls` or Kestrel's `Listen` API aren't required when using the module. If `UseUrls` or `Listen` is called, Kestrel listens on the ports specified only when running the app without IIS.

For more information on the in-process and out-of-process hosting models, see [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module) and [ASP.NET Core Module configuration reference](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module).

`CreateDefaultBuilder` configures [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) server as the web server and enables IIS Integration by configuring the base path and port for the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module).

The ASP.NET Core Module generates a dynamic port to assign to the backend process. `CreateDefaultBuilder` calls the [UseIISIntegration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderiisextensions.useiisintegration) method. `UseIISIntegration` configures Kestrel to listen on the dynamic port at the localhost IP address (`127.0.0.1`). If the dynamic port is 1234, Kestrel listens at `127.0.0.1:1234`. This configuration replaces other URL configurations provided by:

* `UseUrls`
* [Kestrel's Listen API](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#endpoint-configuration)
* [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) (or [command-line --urls option](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#override-configuration))

Calls to `UseUrls` or Kestrel's `Listen` API aren't required when using the module. If `UseUrls` or `Listen` is called, Kestrel listens on the port specified only when running the app without IIS.

`CreateDefaultBuilder` configures [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) server as the web server and enables IIS Integration by configuring the base path and port for the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module).

The ASP.NET Core Module generates a dynamic port to assign to the backend process. `CreateDefaultBuilder` calls the [UseIISIntegration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderiisextensions.useiisintegration) method. `UseIISIntegration` configures Kestrel to listen on the dynamic port at the localhost IP address (`localhost`). If the dynamic port is 1234, Kestrel listens at `localhost:1234`. This configuration replaces other URL configurations provided by:

* `UseUrls`
* [Kestrel's Listen API](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#endpoint-configuration)
* [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) (or [command-line --urls option](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#override-configuration))

Calls to `UseUrls` or Kestrel's `Listen` API aren't required when using the module. If `UseUrls` or `Listen` is called, Kestrel listens on the port specified only when running the app without IIS.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.0"

Include a dependency on the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IISIntegration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IISIntegration/) package in the app's dependencies. Use IIS Integration middleware by adding the [UseIISIntegration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderiisextensions.useiisintegration) extension method to [WebHostBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilder):

```csharp
var host = new WebHostBuilder()
    .UseKestrel()
    .UseIISIntegration()
    ...
```

Both [UseKestrel](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderkestrelextensions.usekestrel) and [UseIISIntegration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderiisextensions.useiisintegration) are required. Code calling `UseIISIntegration` doesn't affect code portability. If the app isn't run behind IIS (for example, the app is run directly on Kestrel), `UseIISIntegration` doesn't operate.

The ASP.NET Core Module generates a dynamic port to assign to the backend process. `UseIISIntegration` configures Kestrel to listen on the dynamic port at the localhost IP address (`localhost`). If the dynamic port is 1234, Kestrel listens at `localhost:1234`. This configuration replaces other URL configurations provided by:

* `UseUrls`
* [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) (or [command-line --urls option](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#override-configuration))

A call to `UseUrls` isn't required when using the module. If `UseUrls` is called, Kestrel listens on the port specified only when running the app without IIS.

If `UseUrls` is called in an ASP.NET Core 1.0 app, call it **before** calling `UseIISIntegration` so that the module-configured port isn't overwritten. This calling order isn't required with ASP.NET Core 1.1 because the module setting overrides `UseUrls`.

For more information on hosting, see [Host in ASP.NET Core](xref:fundamentals/host/index).

### IIS options

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

**In-process hosting model**

To configure IIS Server options, include a service configuration for [IISServerOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.iisserveroptions) in [ConfigureServices](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.istartup.configureservices). The following example disables AutomaticAuthentication:

```csharp
services.Configure<IISServerOptions>(options => 
{
    options.AutomaticAuthentication = false;
});
```

| Option                         | Default | Setting |
| ------------------------------ | :-----: | ------- |
| `AutomaticAuthentication`      | `true`  | If `true`, IIS Server sets the `HttpContext.User` authenticated by [Windows Authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth). If `false`, the server only provides an identity for `HttpContext.User` and responds to challenges when explicitly requested by the `AuthenticationScheme`. Windows Authentication must be enabled in IIS for `AutomaticAuthentication` to function. For more information, see [Windows Authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth). |
| `AuthenticationDisplayName`    | `null`  | Sets the display name shown to users on login pages. |

**Out-of-process hosting model**

::: moniker-end

To configure IIS options, include a service configuration for [IISOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.iisoptions) in [ConfigureServices](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.istartup.configureservices). The following example prevents the app from populating `HttpContext.Connection.ClientCertificate`:

```csharp
services.Configure<IISOptions>(options => 
{
    options.ForwardClientCertificate = false;
});
```

| Option                         | Default | Setting |
| ------------------------------ | :-----: | ------- |
| `AutomaticAuthentication`      | `true`  | If `true`, IIS Integration Middleware sets the `HttpContext.User` authenticated by [Windows Authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth). If `false`, the middleware only provides an identity for `HttpContext.User` and responds to challenges when explicitly requested by the `AuthenticationScheme`. Windows Authentication must be enabled in IIS for `AutomaticAuthentication` to function. For more information, see the [Windows Authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth) topic. |
| `AuthenticationDisplayName`    | `null`  | Sets the display name shown to users on login pages. |
| `ForwardClientCertificate`     | `true`  | If `true` and the `MS-ASPNETCORE-CLIENTCERT` request header is present, the `HttpContext.Connection.ClientCertificate` is populated. |

### Proxy server and load balancer scenarios

The IIS Integration Middleware, which configures Forwarded Headers Middleware, and the ASP.NET Core Module are configured to forward the scheme (HTTP/HTTPS) and the remote IP address where the request originated. Additional configuration might be required for apps hosted behind additional proxy servers and load balancers. For more information, see [Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer).

### web.config file

The *web.config* file configures the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module). Creating, transforming, and publishing the *web.config* file is handled by an MSBuild target (`_TransformWebConfig`) when the project is published. This target is present in the Web SDK targets (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`). The SDK is set at the top of the project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
```

If a *web.config* file isn't present in the project, the file is created with the correct *processPath* and *arguments* to configure the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module) and moved to [published output](xref:host-and-deploy/directory-structure).

If a *web.config* file is present in the project, the file is transformed with the correct *processPath* and *arguments* to configure the ASP.NET Core Module and moved to published output. The transformation doesn't modify IIS configuration settings in the file.

The *web.config* file may provide additional IIS configuration settings that control active IIS modules. For information on IIS modules that are capable of processing requests with ASP.NET Core apps, see the [IIS modules](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/modules) topic.

To prevent the Web SDK from transforming the *web.config* file, use the **\<IsTransformWebConfigDisabled>** property in the project file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <IsTransformWebConfigDisabled>true</IsTransformWebConfigDisabled>
</PropertyGroup>
```

When disabling the Web SDK from transforming the file, the *processPath* and *arguments* should be manually set by the developer. For more information, see the [ASP.NET Core Module configuration reference](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module).

### web.config file location

In order to set up the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module) correctly, the *web.config* file must be present at the content root path (typically the app base path) of the deployed app. This is the same location as the website physical path provided to IIS. The *web.config* file is required at the root of the app to enable the publishing of multiple apps using Web Deploy.

Sensitive files exist on the app's physical path, such as *\<assembly>.runtimeconfig.json*, *\<assembly>.xml* (XML Documentation comments), and *\<assembly>.deps.json*. When the *web.config* file is present and and the site starts normally, IIS doesn't serve these sensitive files if they're requested. If the *web.config* file is missing, incorrectly named, or unable to configure the site for normal startup, IIS may serve sensitive files publicly.

**The *web.config* file must be present in the deployment at all times, correctly named, and able to configure the site for normal start up. Never remove the *web.config* file from a production deployment.**

### web.config transformations

If you require *web.config* transformations (for example, setting environment variables based on the configuration, profile, or environment), see <xref:host-and-deploy/webconfig-transformation>.

## IIS configuration

**Windows Server operating systems**

Enable the **Web Server (IIS)** server role and establish role services.

1. Use the **Add Roles and Features** wizard from the **Manage** menu or the link in **Server Manager**. On the **Server Roles** step, check the box for **Web Server (IIS)**.

   ![The Web Server IIS role is selected in the Select server roles step.](index/_static/server-roles-ws2016.png)

1. After the **Features** step, the **Role services** step loads for Web Server (IIS). Select the IIS role services desired or accept the default role services provided.

   ![The default role services are selected in the Select role services step.](index/_static/role-services-ws2016.png)

   **Windows Authentication (Optional)**  
   To enable Windows Authentication, expand the following nodes: **Web Server** > **Security**. Select the **Windows Authentication** feature. For more information, see [Windows Authentication \<windowsAuthentication>](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/security/authentication/windowsAuthentication/) and [Configure Windows authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth).

   **WebSockets (Optional)**  
   WebSockets is supported with ASP.NET Core 1.1 or later. To enable WebSockets, expand the following nodes: **Web Server** > **Application Development**. Select the **WebSocket Protocol** feature. For more information, see [WebSockets](xref:fundamentals/websockets).

1. Proceed through the **Confirmation** step to install the web server role and services. A server/IIS restart isn't required after installing the **Web Server (IIS)** role.

**Windows desktop operating systems**

Enable the **IIS Management Console** and **World Wide Web Services**.

1. Navigate to **Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Programs and Features** > **Turn Windows features on or off** (left side of the screen).

1. Open the **Internet Information Services** node. Open the **Web Management Tools** node.

1. Check the box for **IIS Management Console**.

1. Check the box for **World Wide Web Services**.

1. Accept the default features for **World Wide Web Services** or customize the IIS features.

   **Windows Authentication (Optional)**  
   To enable Windows Authentication, expand the following nodes: **World Wide Web Services** > **Security**. Select the **Windows Authentication** feature. For more information, see [Windows Authentication \<windowsAuthentication>](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/security/authentication/windowsAuthentication/) and [Configure Windows authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth).

   **WebSockets (Optional)**  
   WebSockets is supported with ASP.NET Core 1.1 or later. To enable WebSockets, expand the following nodes: **World Wide Web Services** > **Application Development Features**. Select the **WebSocket Protocol** feature. For more information, see [WebSockets](xref:fundamentals/websockets).

1. If the IIS installation requires a restart, restart the system.

![IIS Management Console and World Wide Web Services are selected in Windows Features.](index/_static/windows-features-win10.png)

## Install the .NET Core Hosting Bundle

Install the *.NET Core Hosting Bundle* on the hosting system. The bundle installs the .NET Core Runtime, .NET Core Library, and the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module). The module allows ASP.NET Core apps to run behind IIS. If the system doesn't have an Internet connection, obtain and install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53840) before installing the .NET Core Hosting Bundle.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the Hosting Bundle is installed before IIS, the bundle installation must be repaired. Run the Hosting Bundle installer again after installing IIS.

### Direct download (current version)

Download the installer using the following link:

[Current .NET Core Hosting Bundle installer (direct download)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/permalink/dotnetcore-current-windows-runtime-bundle-installer)

### Earlier versions of the installer

To obtain an earlier version of the installer:

1. Navigate to the [.NET download archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives).
1. Under **.NET Core**, select the .NET Core version.
1. In the **Run apps - Runtime** column, find the row of the .NET Core runtime version desired.
1. Download the installer using the **Runtime & Hosting Bundle** link.

> [!WARNING]
> Some installers contain release versions that have reached their end of life (EOL) and are no longer supported by Microsoft. For more information, see the [support policy](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.0).

### Install the Hosting Bundle

1. Run the installer on the server. The following switches are available when running the installer from an administrator command prompt:

   * `OPT_NO_ANCM=1` &ndash; Skip installing the ASP.NET Core Module.
   * `OPT_NO_RUNTIME=1` &ndash; Skip installing the .NET Core runtime.
   * `OPT_NO_SHAREDFX=1` &ndash; Skip installing the ASP.NET Shared Framework (ASP.NET runtime).
   * `OPT_NO_X86=1` &ndash; Skip installing x86 runtimes. Use this switch when you know that you won't be hosting 32-bit apps. If there's any chance that you will host both 32-bit and 64-bit apps in the future, don't use this switch and install both runtimes.
1. Restart the system or execute **net stop was /y** followed by **net start w3svc** from a command prompt. Restarting IIS picks up a change to the system PATH, which is an environment variable, made by the installer.

If the Windows Hosting Bundle installer detects that IIS requires a reset in order to complete installation, the installer resets IIS. If the installer triggers an IIS reset, all of the IIS app pools and websites are restarted.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on IIS Shared Configuration, see [ASP.NET Core Module with IIS Shared Configuration](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module#aspnet-core-module-with-an-iis-shared-configuration).

## Install Web Deploy when publishing with Visual Studio

When deploying apps to servers with [Web Deploy](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/introduction-to-web-deploy), install the latest version of Web Deploy on the server. To install Web Deploy, use the [Web Platform Installer (WebPI)](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) or obtain an installer directly from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=43717). The preferred method is to use WebPI. WebPI offers a standalone setup and a configuration for hosting providers.

## Create the IIS site

1. On the hosting system, create a folder to contain the app's published folders and files. An app's deployment layout is described in the [Directory Structure](xref:host-and-deploy/directory-structure) topic.

1. In **IIS Manager**, open the server's node in the **Connections** panel. Right-click the **Sites** folder. Select **Add Website** from the contextual menu.

1. Provide a **Site name** and set the **Physical path** to the app's deployment folder. Provide the **Binding** configuration and create the website by selecting **OK**:

   ![Supply the Site name, physical path, and Host name in the Add Website step.](index/_static/add-website-ws2016.png)

   > [!WARNING]
   > Top-level wildcard bindings (`http://*:80/` and `http://+:80`) should **not** be used. Top-level wildcard bindings can open up your app to security vulnerabilities. This applies to both strong and weak wildcards. Use explicit host names rather than wildcards. Subdomain wildcard binding (for example, `*.mysub.com`) doesn't have this security risk if you control the entire parent domain (as opposed to `*.com`, which is vulnerable). See [rfc7230 section-5.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4) for more information.

1. Under the server's node, select **Application Pools**.

1. Right-click the site's app pool and select **Basic Settings** from the contextual menu.

1. In the **Edit Application Pool** window, set the **.NET CLR version** to **No Managed Code**:

   ![Set No Managed Code for the .NET CLR version.](index/_static/edit-apppool-ws2016.png)

    ASP.NET Core runs in a separate process and manages the runtime. ASP.NET Core doesn't rely on loading the desktop CLR. Setting the **.NET CLR version** to **No Managed Code** is optional.

1. *ASP.NET Core 2.2 or later*: For a 64-bit (x64) [self-contained deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) that uses the [in-process hosting model](xref:fundamentals/servers/index#in-process-hosting-model), disable the app pool for 32-bit (x86) processes.

   In the **Actions** sidebar of IIS Manager's **Application Pools**, select **Set Application Pool Defaults** or **Advanced Settings**. Locate **Enable 32-Bit Applications** and set the value to `False`. This setting doesn't affect apps deployed for [out-of-process hosting](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module#out-of-process-hosting-model).

1. Confirm the process model identity has the proper permissions.

   If the default identity of the app pool (**Process Model** > **Identity**) is changed from **ApplicationPoolIdentity** to another identity, verify that the new identity has the required permissions to access the app's folder, database, and other required resources. For example, the app pool requires read and write access to folders where the app reads and writes files.

**Windows Authentication configuration (Optional)**  
For more information, see [Configure Windows authentication](xref:security/authentication/windowsauth).

## Deploy the app

Deploy the app to the folder created on the hosting system. [Web Deploy](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/introduction-to-web-deploy) is the recommended mechanism for deployment.

### Web Deploy with Visual Studio

See the [Visual Studio publish profiles for ASP.NET Core app deployment](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles#publish-profiles) topic to learn how to create a publish profile for use with Web Deploy. If the hosting provider provides a Publish Profile or support for creating one, download their profile and import it using the Visual Studio **Publish** dialog.

![Publish dialog page](index/_static/pub-dialog.png)

### Web Deploy outside of Visual Studio

[Web Deploy](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/introduction-to-web-deploy) can also be used outside of Visual Studio from the command line. For more information, see [Web Deployment Tool](/iis/publish/using-web-deploy/use-the-web-deployment-tool).

### Alternatives to Web Deploy

Use any of several methods to move the app to the hosting system, such as manual copy, Xcopy, Robocopy, or PowerShell.

For more information on ASP.NET Core deployment to IIS, see the [Deployment resources for IIS administrators](#deployment-resources-for-iis-administrators) section.

## Browse the website

![The Microsoft Edge browser has loaded the IIS startup page.](index/_static/browsewebsite.png)

## Locked deployment files

Files in the deployment folder are locked when the app is running. Locked files can't be overwritten during deployment. To release locked files in a deployment, stop the app pool using **one** of the following approaches:

* Use Web Deploy and reference `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` in the project file. An *app_offline.htm* file is placed at the root of the web app directory. When the file is present, the ASP.NET Core Module gracefully shuts down the app and serves the *app_offline.htm* file during the deployment. For more information, see the [ASP.NET Core Module configuration reference](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module#app_offlinehtm).
* Manually stop the app pool in the IIS Manager on the server.
* Use PowerShell to drop *app_offline.html* (requires PowerShell 5 or later):

  ```PowerShell
  $pathToApp = 'PATH_TO_APP'

  # Stop the AppPool
  New-Item -Path $pathToApp app_offline.htm

  # Provide script commands here to deploy the app

  # Restart the AppPool
  Remove-Item -Path $pathToApp app_offline.htm

  ```

## Data protection

The [ASP.NET Core Data Protection stack](xref:security/data-protection/introduction) is used by several ASP.NET Core [middlewares](xref:fundamentals/middleware/index), including middleware used in authentication. Even if Data Protection APIs aren't called by user code, data protection should be configured with a deployment script or in user code to create a persistent cryptographic [key store](xref:security/data-protection/implementation/key-management). If data protection isn't configured, the keys are held in memory and discarded when the app restarts.

If the key ring is stored in memory when the app restarts:

* All cookie-based authentication tokens are invalidated. 
* Users are required to sign in again on their next request. 
* Any data protected with the key ring can no longer be decrypted. This may include [CSRF tokens](xref:security/anti-request-forgery#aspnet-core-antiforgery-configuration) and [ASP.NET Core MVC TempData cookies](xref:fundamentals/app-state#tempdata).

To configure data protection under IIS to persist the key ring, use **one** of the following approaches:

* **Create Data Protection Registry Keys**

  Data protection keys used by ASP.NET Core apps are stored in the registry external to the apps. To persist the keys for a given app, create registry keys for the app pool.

  For standalone, non-webfarm IIS installations, the [Data Protection Provision-AutoGenKeys.ps1 PowerShell script](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/src/DataProtection/Provision-AutoGenKeys.ps1) can be used for each app pool used with an ASP.NET Core app. This script creates a registry key in the HKLM registry that's accessible only to the worker process account of the app's app pool. Keys are encrypted at rest using DPAPI with a machine-wide key.

  In web farm scenarios, an app can be configured to use a UNC path to store its data protection key ring. By default, the data protection keys aren't encrypted. Ensure that the file permissions for the network share are limited to the Windows account the app runs under. An X509 certificate can be used to protect keys at rest. Consider a mechanism to allow users to upload certificates: Place certificates into the user's trusted certificate store and ensure they're available on all machines where the user's app runs. See [Configure ASP.NET Core Data Protection](xref:security/data-protection/configuration/overview) for details.

* **Configure the IIS Application Pool to load the user profile**

  This setting is in the **Process Model** section under the **Advanced Settings** for the app pool. Set Load User Profile to `True`. This stores keys under the user profile directory and protects them using DPAPI with a key specific to the user account used by the app pool.

* **Use the file system as a key ring store**

  Adjust the app code to [use the file system as a key ring store](xref:security/data-protection/configuration/overview). Use an X509 certificate to protect the key ring and ensure the certificate is a trusted certificate. If the certificate is self-signed, place the certificate in the Trusted Root store.

  When using IIS in a web farm:

  * Use a file share that all machines can access.
  * Deploy an X509 certificate to each machine. Configure [data protection in code](xref:security/data-protection/configuration/overview).

* **Set a machine-wide policy for data protection**

  The data protection system has limited support for setting a default [machine-wide policy](xref:security/data-protection/configuration/machine-wide-policy) for all apps that consume the Data Protection APIs. For more information, see <xref:security/data-protection/introduction>.

## Virtual Directories

[IIS Virtual Directories](/iis/get-started/planning-your-iis-architecture/understanding-sites-applications-and-virtual-directories-on-iis#virtual-directories) aren't supported with ASP.NET Core apps. An app can be hosted as a [sub-application](#sub-applications).

## Sub-applications

An ASP.NET Core app can be hosted as an [IIS sub-application (sub-app)](/iis/get-started/planning-your-iis-architecture/understanding-sites-applications-and-virtual-directories-on-iis#applications). The sub-app's path becomes part of the root app's URL.

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.2"

A sub-app shouldn't include the ASP.NET Core Module as a handler. If the module is added as a handler in a sub-app's *web.config* file, a *500.19 Internal Server Error* referencing the faulty config file is received when attempting to browse the sub-app.

The following example shows a published *web.config* file for an ASP.NET Core sub-app:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" 
      arguments=".\MyApp.dll" 
      stdoutLogEnabled="false" 
      stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

When hosting a non-ASP.NET Core sub-app underneath an ASP.NET Core app, explicitly remove the inherited handler in the sub-app's *web.config* file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <remove name="aspNetCore" />
    </handlers>
    <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" 
      arguments=".\MyApp.dll" 
      stdoutLogEnabled="false" 
      stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

Static asset links within the sub-app should use tilde-slash (`~/`) notation. Tilde-slash notation triggers a [Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro) to prepend the sub-app's pathbase to the rendered relative link. For a sub-app at `/subapp_path`, an image linked with `src="~/image.png"` is rendered as `src="/subapp_path/image.png"`. The root app's Static File Middleware doesn't process the static file request. The request is processed by the sub-app's Static File Middleware.

If a static asset's `src` attribute is set to an absolute path (for example, `src="/image.png"`), the link is rendered without the sub-app's pathbase. The root app's Static File Middleware attempts to serve the asset from the root app's [webroot](xref:fundamentals/index#web-root-webroot), which results in a *404 - Not Found* response unless the static asset is available from the root app.

To host an ASP.NET Core app as a sub-app under another ASP.NET Core app:

1. Establish an app pool for the sub-app. Set the **.NET CLR Version** to **No Managed Code**.

1. Add the root site in IIS Manager with the sub-app in a folder under the root site.

1. Right-click the sub-app folder in IIS Manager and select **Convert to Application**.

1. In the **Add Application** dialog, use the **Select** button for the **Application Pool** to assign the app pool that you created for the sub-app. Select **OK**.

The assignment of a separate app pool to the sub-app is a requirement when using the in-process hosting model.

For more information on the in-process hosting model and configuring the ASP.NET Core Module, see <xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module> and <xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module>.

## Configuration of IIS with web.config

IIS configuration is influenced by the `<system.webServer>` section of *web.config* for IIS scenarios that are functional for ASP.NET Core apps with the ASP.NET Core Module. For example, IIS configuration is functional for dynamic compression. If IIS is configured at the server level to use dynamic compression, the `<urlCompression>` element in the app's *web.config* file can disable it for an ASP.NET Core app.

For more information, see the [configuration reference for \<system.webServer>](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/), [ASP.NET Core Module Configuration Reference](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module), and [IIS Modules with ASP.NET Core](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/modules). To set environment variables for individual apps running in isolated app pools (supported for IIS 10.0 or later), see the *AppCmd.exe command* section of the [Environment Variables \<environmentVariables>](/iis/configuration/system.applicationHost/applicationPools/add/environmentVariables/#appcmdexe) topic in the IIS reference documentation.

## Configuration sections of web.config

Configuration sections of ASP.NET 4.x apps in *web.config* aren't used by ASP.NET Core apps for configuration:

* `<system.web>`
* `<appSettings>`
* `<connectionStrings>`
* `<location>`

ASP.NET Core apps are configured using other configuration providers. For more information, see [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index).

## Application Pools

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

App pool isolation is determined by the hosting model:

* In-process hosting &ndash; Apps are required to run in separate app pools.
* Out-of-process hosting &ndash; We recommend isolating the apps from each other by running each app in its own app pool.

The IIS **Add Website** dialog defaults to a single app pool per app. When a **Site name** is provided, the text is automatically transferred to the **Application pool** textbox. A new app pool is created using the site name when the site is added.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.2"

When hosting multiple websites on a server, we recommend isolating the apps from each other by running each app in its own app pool. The IIS **Add Website** dialog defaults to this configuration. When a **Site name** is provided, the text is automatically transferred to the **Application pool** textbox. A new app pool is created using the site name when the site is added.

::: moniker-end

## Application Pool Identity

An app pool identity account allows an app to run under a unique account without having to create and manage domains or local accounts. On IIS 8.0 or later, the IIS Admin Worker Process (WAS) creates a virtual account with the name of the new app pool and runs the app pool's worker processes under this account by default. In the IIS Management Console under **Advanced Settings** for the app pool, ensure that the **Identity** is set to use **ApplicationPoolIdentity**:

![Application pool advanced settings dialog](index/_static/apppool-identity.png)

The IIS management process creates a secure identifier with the name of the app pool in the Windows Security System. Resources can be secured using this identity. However, this identity isn't a real user account and doesn't show up in the Windows User Management Console.

If the IIS worker process requires elevated access to the app, modify the Access Control List (ACL) for the directory containing the app:

1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the directory.

1. Right-click on the directory and select **Properties**.

1. Under the **Security** tab, select the **Edit** button and then the **Add** button.

1. Select the **Locations** button and make sure the system is selected.

1. Enter **IIS AppPool\\<app_pool_name>** in **Enter the object names to select** area. Select the **Check Names** button. For the *DefaultAppPool* check the names using **IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool**. When the **Check Names** button is selected, a value of **DefaultAppPool** is indicated in the object names area. It isn't possible to enter the app pool name directly into the object names area. Use the **IIS AppPool\\<app_pool_name>** format when checking for the object name.

   ![Select users or groups dialog for the app folder: The app pool name of "DefaultAppPool" is appended to "IIS AppPool\" in the object names area before selecting "Check Names."](index/_static/select-users-or-groups-1.png)

1. Select **OK**.

   ![Select users or groups dialog for the app folder: After selecting "Check Names," the object name "DefaultAppPool" is shown in the object names area.](index/_static/select-users-or-groups-2.png)

1. Read &amp; execute permissions should be granted by default. Provide additional permissions as needed.

Access can also be granted at a command prompt using the **ICACLS** tool. Using the *DefaultAppPool* as an example, the following command is used:

```console
ICACLS C:\sites\MyWebApp /grant "IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool":F
```

For more information, see the [icacls](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) topic.

## HTTP/2 support

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

[HTTP/2](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html) is supported with ASP.NET Core in the following IIS deployment scenarios:

* In-process
  * Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later; IIS 10 or later
  * TLS 1.2 or later connection
* Out-of-process
  * Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later; IIS 10 or later
  * Public-facing edge server connections use HTTP/2, but the reverse proxy connection to the [Kestrel server](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) uses HTTP/1.1.
  * TLS 1.2 or later connection

For an in-process deployment when an HTTP/2 connection is established, [HttpRequest.Protocol](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpRequest.Protocol*) reports `HTTP/2`. For an out-of-process deployment when an HTTP/2 connection is established, [HttpRequest.Protocol](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpRequest.Protocol*) reports `HTTP/1.1`.

For more information on the in-process and out-of-process hosting models, see the <xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module> topic and the <xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module>.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.2"

[HTTP/2](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html) is supported for out-of-process deployments that meet the following base requirements:

* Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later; IIS 10 or later
* Public-facing edge server connections use HTTP/2, but the reverse proxy connection to the [Kestrel server](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) uses HTTP/1.1.
* Target framework: Not applicable to out-of-process deployments, since the HTTP/2 connection is handled entirely by IIS.
* TLS 1.2 or later connection

If an HTTP/2 connection is established, [HttpRequest.Protocol](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpRequest.Protocol*) reports `HTTP/1.1`.

::: moniker-end

HTTP/2 is enabled by default. Connections fall back to HTTP/1.1 if an HTTP/2 connection isn't established. For more information on HTTP/2 configuration with IIS deployments, see [HTTP/2 on IIS](/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10/http2-on-iis).

## CORS preflight requests

*This section only applies to ASP.NET Core apps that target the .NET Framework.*

For an ASP.NET Core app that targets the .NET Framework, OPTIONS requests aren't passed to the app by default in IIS. To learn how to configure the app's IIS handlers in *web.config* to pass OPTIONS requests, see [Enable cross-origin requests in ASP.NET Web API 2: How CORS Works](/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api#how-cors-works).
